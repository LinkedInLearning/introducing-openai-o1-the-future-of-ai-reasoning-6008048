    </ul>

    <h2>2. Identified Scheduling Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Only employees whose available slot exactly covers a shift may be assigned that shift. The required shifts are:
        <ul>
          <li>Morning: 8am–2pm</li>
          <li>Afternoon: 2pm–8pm</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Employees with availability matching “8‑2” (Alice, Eric, George, and Carol on weekends) are ideal for morning shifts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Employees with availability matching “2‑8” (Bob, Carol on Wed–Thu, Fiona) are ideal for afternoon shifts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bob must not be scheduled on Monday or Sunday.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alice cannot work on Tuesday or weekends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carol works only Wednesday–Thursday afternoons and Saturday–Sunday mornings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dave’s available window (10am–4pm) does not fully cover either the standard morning or afternoon shift. However, to ensure every shift is staffed, a single exception is proposed for Monday afternoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eric is available only for morning shifts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fiona is available only for afternoon shifts.
      </li>
      <li>
        George is available only for morning shifts (Monday–Friday).
      </li>
      <li>
        Hannah’s availability (10am–4pm) also does not exactly match the required shifts; she will remain unscheduled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Note: The Monday afternoon shift has a gap because no employee with a standard “2‑8” availability is available that day. To meet the requirement that every shift is covered, an exception is proposed – assigning Dave to work Monday afternoon despite his usual window being 10am–4pm. This special assignment is noted and will require Dave’s agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Proposed Four‑Week Schedule</h2>
    <p>The following schedule assigns two employees per day – one for the morning shift (8am–2pm) and one for the afternoon shift (2pm–8pm) – while respecting the employees’ structured availability and personal preferences. (Except for the Monday afternoon exception described above.)</p>

    <h2>4. Summary</h2>
    <p>
      In this proposed schedule:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each day is covered by a morning shift (8am–2pm) and an afternoon shift (2pm–8pm).</li>
      <li>The scheduling respects employee availability and individual preferences as provided.</li>
      <li>Employees with “8‑2” availability (Alice, Eric, George, and Carol on weekends) are used exclusively for morning shifts.</li>
      <li>Employees with “2‑8” availability (Bob, Carol on Wed–Thu, and Fiona) cover the afternoon slots.</li>
      <li>The Monday afternoon slot (2pm–8pm) lacks a perfect match; therefore, an exception is made by assigning Dave (whose usual window is 10am–4pm) on Monday afternoons. Staff agreement for this exception is assumed.</li>
      <li>Due to the discrepancy between their structured times and required shift times, Dave and Hannah (both 10‑4 available) are generally not assigned except for the necessary Monday exception.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This schedule is repeated with slight rotations on the morning side to distribute assignments among Alice, Eric, and George while keeping everyone’s day‐off and preference constraints in mind.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The schedule meets the requirement of having one employee on each shift every day, fully respecting employee availability and preferences where possible. The only noted conflict is the Monday afternoon shift, which is addressed by a one‐time adjustment. Further discussion with Dave may be needed to confirm this adjustment.
