<!-- 2. Analysis of Unstructured Transcripts for Each Medium and High-Risk Case -->
<div class="risk-section">
    <h2>2. Analysis of Unstructured Transcripts</h2>

    <h3>High-Risk Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>C001 (Adams):</strong> Email about a duplicate $499.99 charge. Customer claims they only made one purchase. No direct contradictions; requests investigation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C002 (Baker):</strong> Call where the caller refused to provide SSN, demanded reversal of unauthorized charges. Heightened suspicion due to refusal of ID checks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C006 (Franklin):</strong> Call transcript shows caller tried skipping identity checks, requested urgent refund of $200 without proof. Indicates possible fraud.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C011 (Keller):</strong> Call with aggressive refusal to answer security questions, threatened legal action if $1,000+ charges not reversed. Remains suspicious.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C015 (Owens):</strong> SMS about a $500 foreign currency transaction. Asking to confirm legitimacy. No contradictory statements, but still a high-risk trigger.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C017 (Quinn):</strong> Call with uncertain details about a $900 cryptocurrency purchase; caller gave contradictory info on location/date. Suggests heightened risk.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C020 (Taylor):</strong> Email from overseas location acknowledging $600 hotel and flight charges. Claims they are legitimate, but flagged as high risk due to travel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C024 (Xie):</strong> Email stating $450 luxury shoe purchase is valid (for work travel). Remains high risk given purchase profile; no proof or contradiction provided.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C026 (Zhang):</strong> SMS about a $750 laptop purchase flagged due to new shipping address. Customer insists it is legitimate but remains under high-risk scrutiny.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C029 (Chan):</strong> Chat ended abruptly after customer refused to verify $1,500 electronics purchase. Location mismatch. Strongly suspicious behavior.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Medium-Risk Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>C004 (Davis):</strong> Call about a $350 airfare dispute. Customer later admitted it was legitimate for an upcoming trip, suggesting initial dispute was confusion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C007 (Garcia):</strong> Email alleging ID theft for a $2,000 jewelry purchase in another state. Denies authorizing the transaction; no contradictory info found.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C009 (Ingram):</strong> Chat denying travel out of state for a transaction in Florida. Customer denies any such trip. Could be fraudulent or mistaken identity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C013 (Miller):</strong> Call uncertain about a $120 car part brand. The customer recalls ordering “something” but details are fuzzy. Moderate suspicion remains.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C019 (Sanchez):</strong> Call where customer is confused about $50 accessory charges. Possibly a family member used the card. Unclear but still flagged medium risk.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C022 (Vargas):</strong> Email inquiring about purchasing ten $100 gift cards in one transaction. Unusual bulk purchase. Remains under medium-risk investigation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>C028 (Braun):</strong> Call initially claimed identity theft on a $400 purchase, then changed the story saying a friend borrowed the card. Contradictory explanation.
        </li>
    </ul>

<!-- 3. & 4. Detecting False Positives and Table -->
<div class="risk-section">
    <h2>3. False Positives Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        After examining transcripts for contradictions or legitimate explanations, only one case appears to be a clear false positive:
    </p>

    <table class="false-positive-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Customer ID</th>
                <th>Reason Flagged as Suspicious</th>
                <th>Reason for False Positive</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>C004 (Davis)</td>
                <td>$350 airfare charge dispute; transaction triggered a medium-risk alert.</td>
                <td>Customer later admitted to booking the flight for next month. The confusion over posting date caused the initial dispute, which turned out to be a legitimate purchase.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<!-- 5. Plain-Text Summary -->
<div class="report">
    <h3>Plain-Text Summary of Findings</h3>
    <p>
        After reviewing the transactions and associated transcripts, the following observations were made:
    </p>
    <p>
        • High-risk customers generally showed patterns such as refusing standard security checks, insisting on immediate refunds without proof, or showing contradictory travel or purchase details.  
        • Medium-risk customers raised concerns due to unusual purchases, partial recall of transactions, or purchases typical of fraud patterns (e.g., bulk gift cards).  
        • One notable false positive was Customer C004, who initially disputed airfare charges but later acknowledged the purchase. This confusion was misinterpreted as fraud.  
        • No other medium or high-risk cases showed clear contradictions or final notes indicating a legitimate explanation for the flagged risk.  
        • Thus, only one clear false positive (C004) was identified. All other cases remain under suspicion or require further investigation.
