    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        A review of the provided data revealed several medium and high-risk transactions flagged for their potential to indicate fraudulent activity. 
        Using the unstructured data, some cases were found to be legitimate through customer correspondence and behavior analysis. 
        These identified false positives are summarized in the table above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notably:
        <ul>
            <li>Customer C001 was flagged due to duplicate charges, but their email provides sufficient evidence of legitimate action.</li>
            <li>Customer C004 initially disputed a charge but later admitted to making the purchase.</li>
            <li>Customer C020 confirmed the legitimacy of their international travel expenses via email.</li>
            <li>Customer C024 justified a luxury purchase as work-related in their email.</li>
            <li>Customer C028 initially claimed identity theft but later admitted the card was used with permission by a friend.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        These findings emphasize the importance of cross-referencing structured data with unstructured communications to accurately differentiate fraudulent activity from genuine transactions.
