    "# Lab 03: Document Risk Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the document risk analysis capabilities of O-Series reasoning models by combining multiple datasets with enhanced reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It serves as a practical demonstration of fraud detection, leveraging unstructured (transaction logs) and structured (emails, transcripts, sms) data to improve decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "These flagged transactions are fictitious, lab-generated credit/debit card purchases designed to illustrate common patterns of fraud (e.g., large purchases on new devices, location mismatches). In real systems, similar transaction data might flow in from bank payment networks, e‑commerce platforms, or internal databases that log user activities and device usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case managers, responsible for investigating flagged transactions, often face an overwhelming number of alerts with limited context. Traditional systems generate excessive noise, making it difficult to identify truly fraudulent cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enhances case managers’ efficiency by:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Linking transaction data with customer complaints\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Prioritizing high-risk cases using AI-powered reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Providing meaningful insights to reduce manual workload\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating o-series models for document risk analysis, this system ensures that case managers focus on the most critical cases, detect fraud faster, and take informed action."

    "In scenarios involving thousands of alerts, o3-mini models can be leveraged for initial bulk data analysis to narrow down the alerts to a manageable subset. Subsequently, more advanced models like o1 can be utilized to scrutinize these alerts, enabling a more cost-efficient and accurate workflow. This layered approach optimizes resource allocation and enhances the precision of fraud detection."
