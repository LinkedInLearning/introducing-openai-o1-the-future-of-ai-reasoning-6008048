## Course Description

This course explores OpenAI's reasoning model (o-Series) focusing on its advanced reasoning capabilities and practical applications in business and scientific contexts. Instructor Anurag Karuparti covers everything from fundamental concepts and technical implementations to ethical considerations and future development. Test out your new skills along the way with practical hands-on exercises in coding, risk analysis, and safety implementations. By the end of this course, you’ll be prepared to leverage o-Series unique features, including its inference scaling architecture and chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities.

## Course Overview

In this course, you will learn how to:
- Utilize OpenAI models for advanced reasoning tasks.
- Design and refine prompts for better model performance.
- Build practical applications using interactive labs and coding challenges.
- Integrate AI reasoning techniques into existing software projects.

## Repository Structure

- **Labs:** Each lab folder (e.g., Lab 01 Prompt Engineering, Lab 02 Software Development, etc.) contains a Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step exercises.
- **Data:** Contains datasets and supporting input files for various labs.
- **Output:** Stores files generated by the notebooks, such as HTML reports and game outputs.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the Python dependencies required to run the notebooks and scripts.
- **README.md:** This file – providing an overview and instructions for the course.
