       "Okay, let me start by reading through the user's query and the provided biomarker report. The user wants an expert analysis of Jane Doe's medical data, including extracting abnormal biomarkers, identifying patterns, suggesting next steps, and providing lifestyle advice. They want this in plain text but formatted as HTML.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I need to parse the biomarker report. Looking through the 40 biomarkers, most are within normal ranges. The key ones flagged are Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides, and CRP. Each has their reference ranges and notes indicating they're high or low.\n",
       "\n",
       "Total Cholesterol is 250 (ref <200), LDL 160 (ref <100), HDL 45 (ref >50 for females), Triglycerides 180 (ref <150), and CRP at 3 (ref <3). These are the abnormal values. The others are all normal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next, identifying patterns. High LDL and Total Cholesterol point to hyperlipidemia, which increases cardiovascular risk. Low HDL adds to that. Triglycerides being mildly elevated is another lipid issue. CRP at the upper limit suggests possible inflammation, which could be related to cardiovascular risk or other inflammation sources.\n",
       "\n",
       "For next steps, since the lipid panel is the main issue, a lipid profile retest makes sense. Also, checking inflammation causes with more tests like hs-CRP or ESR. Maybe liver function tests since ALT is at the upper normal range, but the note says it's normal. Wait, ALT is 30, which is within 7-35, so actually normal. So maybe not necessary. Focus on lipids and inflammation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Diet recommendations should target lowering LDL and triglycerides. Increase fiber, omega-3s, reduce saturated fats, sugars. Exercise advice: aerobic and resistance training to improve HDL and lower LDL. Weight management if needed, but the report doesn't mention weight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Potential clinical correlations: High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), inflammation, increased cardiovascular risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "Need to make sure all info only comes from the data provided. No other assumptions. Present in simple language, HTML formatted. Avoid medical jargon as much as possible, but still accurate.\n",
       "\n",
       "Check if all the abnormal biomarkers are correctly extracted. CRP is exactly at 3, which is the upper limit, so it's noted. HDL is slightly below female reference. Triglycerides are mildly elevated. LDL is elevated.\n",
       "\n",
       "Possible next steps include confirming lipid levels, assessing inflammation further, and lifestyle changes. No mention of diabetes or kidney issues since glucose, HbA1c, eGFR are normal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Diet: Emphasize whole grains, vegetables, healthy fats like avocado, nuts. Avoid trans fats, high-sugar foods. Exercise: 150 mins moderate aerobic, plus strength training.\n",
